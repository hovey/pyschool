# Convention

## Convention > Configuration

Code should just run the first time, without clients needing to spend excessive amount of time configuring prior to the run.  Services should use default values.  Allow clients to modify the default values through the service's API.

## Customization is not Configuration

Customization is alteration of settings, either from convention or configuration, on code that already runs.  Customization means to personalize the settings to the preferences of a user.
