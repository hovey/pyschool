From the database standard, there are four main verbs that span all tranactions: 

* **CREATE** - aka calculate, compute, evaluate, generate, make, new
* **READ** *this is **get***, copy, fetch, serialize (with read)
* **UPDATE** *this is **set***, serialize (with write), write
* **DELETE** typically not used except for memory management, or dropping a record from a database
