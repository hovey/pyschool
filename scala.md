Grep for "why scala"

* https://blog.softwaremill.com/why-scala-a6ac8c98c541
  * better Java
  * for abstractions
  * distributed and concurrent programming
  * immutability is favored, which promotes concurrency
  * wrappers for coding async or reactive styles
  * Scala and Kotlin advantages over Java
  * disc: if Scala 3 should move from FP/OO to only FP
* https://youtu.be/t7SOXNJVbJo by Adam Warski
  * why scala, best way to do FP in a business setting
  * immutable first, all libraries work with immutable data structures
  * thread safety
  * "allStreets" (at 6:00 timestamp) example was very cool
  * compile-time proofs instead of runtime tests
  * advantage 4: libraries not frameworks
  * delegate tests to computer by way of compiler
  * helps dev migrate from OO to FP (scala 3)

  * interesting table of comparisons between languages, including Python
  * enjoyable read to motivate the "why" of scala
  * "At small scale, the personal preference between static typechecking doesn't matter. At larger scale, the lack of static typechecking is a huge pain point for anyone maintaining a system."
  * scalability of scala (ha ha), as a prime advantage, by way of static type checking.
  * discussion blog at end incorporates users' views from using Scala for n years
  * interesting discussion

  * Really nice talk, throat irritation distraction
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLFl95c-IiU (so cool showing OOP jargin is familiar, FP is not)
  * breaks away from jargon, and works to communicate and share, rather than exclude
  * Legos appear as a concept for composition at 18:30 timestamp
    * behavior (verb) and data (noun) are separate; opposite of OOP
