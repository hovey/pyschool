    "# Domain Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "[Book Code](https://github.com/cosmicpython/code/tree/chapter_01_domain_model_exercise)\n",
    "\n",
    "* How can we model business practices with code in a way that is compatible with TDD?\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Domain Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Domain* is the problem you're trying to solve\n",
    "* A *domain model* is the mental map clients have of the problem\n",
    "* Jargon arises naturally in a domain model\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Read Domain-Driven Design by Eric Evans**\n",
    "* **Read Implementing Domain-Driving Design by Vaughn Vernon**\n",
    "* Main idea: Software is valuable when it is a useful model of a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimal Example\n",
    "This is an example of notes we might take for a company\n",
    "\n",
    "* A product is defined by a SKU.\n",
    "* Customers place orders\n",
    "* An order is IDed by an order reference and comprises multiple order lines, where each line contains a SKU and a quantity\n",
    "* The purchasing department orders batches of stock. A batch of stock has a unique ID called a reference, an SKU, and a quantity\n",
    "* We need to allocate order lines to batches. When we've allocated an order line to a batch, we need to send units from that batch to the customer's address.\n",
    "* When we allocate x units of stock from a batch, the available quantity is reduced by x.\n",
    "* We can't allocate to a batch if the available quantity is less than the quantity of the order line.\n",
    "* We can't allocate the same line twice.\n",
    "* If we allocate the same line twice, the quantity should remain unchanged\n",
    "* Batches have an ETA if they are currently shipping. Else, they may be in warehouse stock.\n",
    "* We prefer to allocate to warehouse stock.\n",
    "* If there isn't enough warehouse stock, we prefer to allocate to batches with the smallest ETA\n",
    "\n",
    "* The [chapter 1 code](https://github.com/hovey/pyschool/tree/master/src/apwp/code/chapter_01) does implements according to the above spec.\n",
    "* Notice how our tests are named using domain jargon.\n",
    "* This is ripe for BDD tbh.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Value Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "* `OrderLine` is implemented as a `NamedTuple`. This is an example of something that follows the *Value Object Pattern*\n",
    "* A value object is something that contains data, but no identity. \n",
    "* They are typically immutable\n",
    "* Because they don't have an identity, we can do operations with them.\n",
    "* `dataclass` and `NamedTuple` are both examples of value objects"
