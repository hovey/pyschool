    "* Enables decoupling model layer from the data layer\n",

    "## Applying the DIP to Data Access\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recall that we're buliding up a 3-layered architecture (presentation layer -> business layer -> data layer)\n",
    "* Our goal is to keep layers separate - each layer should only depend on the layer below it.\n",
    "* However, our domain model should have *no* dependencies.\n",
    "* Infrastructure concerns shouldn't slow our ability to make changes to our domain model\n",
    "* As a result, let's move from our 3-layered architecture to an onion architecture: presentation layer -> domain model <- database layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reminder: Our Model\n",
    "\n",
    "* An `OrderLine` is stored to a `Batch` as an allocation.\n",

    "### The \"Normal\" ORM Way: Model Depends on ORM\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rather than creating custom SQL queries, the team are likely using some framework to generate queries based on model objects.\n",
    "* These frameworks are called *object-relational mappers* (ORMs).\n",
    "* They map objects and domain models to databases and relational algebra.\n",
    "* ORMs give us *persistence ignorance* - domain model doesn't need to know how data is loaded or persisted."

    "    * An ORM already does some decoupling.\n",
