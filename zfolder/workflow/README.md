# Workflow

This is a step-by-step tutorial of a workflow with a feature branch using Git, and GitHub for [Continuous Integration](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/guides/about-continuous-integration) (CI) and enforcement of code format with [Black](https://github.com/psf/black), which is a superset of [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

## Overview - the "Big Picture"

You will 

1. [**learn**](learn.md) about a software development effort, 
2. [**dev**](dev.md) (aka "develop" or "implement") a feature on your own, then 
3. [**propose**](propose.md) your feature to be included in the next version of software.
